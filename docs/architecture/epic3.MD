## BEFORE JOB CREATED

Before a task got created by the organisation, we should reinforce the checking. It will reduce lots of checking for the Ops Member. Even an AI checking, chat GPT suggestions for job description can be good here. We can in this case eliminate lots of things to review for the ops member.

## On the review:

A jira type of board can be good. For every job created we can put it into:

- New 
- In review
- Approuved
- Refuse (return to the company)

The job can have a tag system. This way we can recommend the job to the best possible Ops member so they can review it the fastest way.


## After the review

- On the refuse: communicate with the company to show them what went wrong can take a lots of time in this case. A chat channel directly with company can be a good choice.
