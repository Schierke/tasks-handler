## Getting started
Before you start, make sure you have golang and docker installed with lastest version

For local execution, I recommend using task.

## INSTALL

First installation: the easiest way is to do ```task local``` to launching mongoDB only. Then ```task migrate``` for creating collections. 

(Or if mongo is already launch, just task migrate is enough)

For second, third time, just ```task develop``` for launching everything 


### Testing

You can import the postman file inside ```docs/postman``` for testing purpose.
